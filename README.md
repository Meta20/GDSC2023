# Transparency in Carbon Credit using Blockchain

## About

Creating a secure execution environment which can execute go programs by taking input data , perform the execution of the program, generate output / make state changes.(Secure Smart Contract execution environment)


## Objectives

1. Configure and set up a secured smart contract environment where organization can join  and manage and view data. 
2. The participating organizations should be able to record their day-to-day transactions which will be directly coming from MQ-135 sensors. 
3. The application would be capable of calculating carbon credit in a parameterized and configurable manner through Global warming potential.
4. The platform would be able to integrate with core systems considering real world scenarios.
5. Organizations would be able to view the carbon transactions and the updated wallet.
6. The solution should maintain privacy in the system with proper access control mechanisms.


## Proposed System

1. Organizations will be able to sign up securely and two contracts will be available. First is the Organization factory where the features and information of ledger will be available and second will be the new organization contract where new org will be able to join through smart contract. 

2. After successful sign-in, the organizations will be redirected to the dashboard and through MQ-135 sensors the data entry will be automatically done for the various gases. After the process of data entry, organizations will be able to approve the automated data through sensors  and then the carbon credit calculation will take place through the algorithm which uses Global Warming potential. Thereafter the transaction sheet will be updated.

3. Through the wallet option on the dashboard, one can see the organization id and contract id through which the organizations will be connected. We can also view the credit allotted, credit used and available credit option.

4. After the completion of the process, we will be able to view all the updated information on the dashboard.





## Methodology

1. Blockchain: It is a shared and immutable way of storing transactions that provides transparency of data by sharing data to all nodes in the network.
2. Interface:  It mainly constitutes of the dashboard, wallet section and transaction section. The process of sign-in to automatic redirected data will be visible on dashboard. Through transaction page we will be able to get to know the approved transactions from the organizations and the information on the credits can be seen under wallet section.
3. Sensor: For detecting Co2 gas we are using MQ135 co2 sensor with a measuring range 0~1000ppm.
4. Data Management and Calculation: This data coming from the sensor is stored and pushed into the Blockchain ledger on a daily basis. These sensors are fixed in all the major hot spots where GHG gas is produced and store the data from all sensors in one place. Similarly, concentration of all other major GHG gas (N2O, CH4, HFC, PFC,SF6) is calculated.

## Conclusions

1. While developing or building this model we have come to the conclusion that with growing consciousness among nations to limit industrial  GHG pollution together with positive industrial growth, the emission touting appears to be the chief area of business attraction today.
2. Here we have tried to create a Blockchain platform that will allow high-emitting organizations to detect their carbon footprints and mingle their quotas by acquiring carbon credits from low emitters.
3. The setup spot for CO2 sensors has been made in such a way that it should follow up the law made up by the government organizations to achieve the purpose of giving accurate and errorless values of the liberated CO2 gas.


## Future Scope

1. Currently we are calculating carbon credit only for scope 1 where we calculate for gases but in future we will try to add scope 2 and 3 to get exact measure and data of the organizations emitting carbon credits. 
2. We will add the option of vetting agencies where they will be able to view the transaction of the organizations.
